Assignment

This assignment is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis. 

#### Data Modeling

Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables. Feel free to use a tool like [http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com](http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com).

#### Data Engineering

* Use the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Remember to specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

  * For the primary keys, verify that the column is unique. Otherwise, create a [composite key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_key), which takes two primary keys to uniquely identify a row.

  * Be sure to create tables in the correct order to handle foreign keys.

* Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.
